      <p class="section-description">When we began the brainstorming process, we wanted to make sure that we encapsulated everything entrepreneurs are looking for from our research into our application.<br><br>We wanted to continue to inspire those
        who are waking up early in
        the morning to work on their side hustles. That is were the name Empresario came along. It is a word which is the direct translation of entrepreneur and a phonetically similar word to impresario. We wanted the app to be associated with
        the idea of inspiration, hard work, and dedication. Our focus was on those who are hustling every day to build their own empires.<br></p>

          <h4 class="style-guide-branding">Logo</h4>
          <p class="style-guide-branding">The logo was a unique blend of many ideas that we wanted to fuse into one. We first began with the idea of one of the largest empires in human history, the Roman empire. We started with some simple sketches
            trying to get ideas flowing.
            Once we had a foundation for what we were looking for in our logo we began to develop more detailed renderings in Adobe Illustrator. We based our logo in an abstract shape of some of the helmets worn by the Roman gladiators. We
            made this shape by taking silhouettes of skyscrapers which resemble today's modern empires.<br></p>

          <p class="style-guide-branding">We also wanted to promote the same message in our typography. For the Brand Typefaces we chose BlairMdITC TT as we felt it had a refined and sophisticated feel to it. Montserrat was chosen for its versatility
            as well as its clean aesthetic
            composition. We selected fonts that had a strong impact and audience engagement. We wanted both typefaces to be strong enough to represent the brand.<br></p>

        features without too much
        distraction. The challenge we ran into was creating that clean and uncluttered dashboard with so many elements at hand. <br><br>In order to overcome this challenge, we added a lot of negative space and padding around elements. We also
        had large, clear, legible fonts in an organized hierarchy. The combination of both of these techniques promoted the use of visual cues to help guide users accomplish their important task. <br></p>

      <p class="section-description">One of the most important features of Empresario was the intuitive dashboard.<br><br>It was were users would spend most of their time. I wanted to emphasize creativity without losing organization. In the
        dashboard, users would be able to get
        a glance of their day’s schedule as well as the weather. Users would have AI generated content based on their work pattern for a more efficient work flow solving one of the major frustrations from our research. <br><br>We made sure to
        provide easy access to the search bar and more importantly effortless access to upload or create a new file. The left side menu would also contain easy access to the team and project management portion of the app. All of this in a single
        application. <br></p>

      <h2 class="heading-left-center">Preference Test</h2>
      <p class="section-description">From the lo-fi mock up and user testing we learned to create enough space to create a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing sensation. We took away some of the elements. A challenged we ran into was that we were
        some elements we were unsure
        if to integrate into the visual design or not. In order to solve this dilemma, we turned to gathering feedback using Usability Hub’s preference test. <br></p>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-6 border">
          <h3 class="preference-test-title">Preference Test 1</h3>
          <p class="preference-test-1">We asked users if they preferred having a quote vs Not having one. Our results concluded that most would in fact prefer a quote as they felt more inspired by it. This was a cloud storage app tailored towards
            entrepreneurs so it only
            seemed appropriate. Although for the final design we had to modify the placement of the quote in order to create a much cleaner and more visual hierarchy.<br></p>

          <p class="preference-test-1">Another test that allowed us to learn critical and valuable feedback from our users came from the create an account screen. Although there was something more aesthetically pleasing from the minimal design of the
            lines for information
            input, most of our users preferred the more robust blank boxes. The comments we received mention that they were able to get a clearer visual of where they were supposed to input data. All of this information allowed us to get a
            better understanding of what users wanted and provide a more refined prototype. <br></p>

          if users would like a certain element
          in our design. However based on our intensive user research and detailed user feedback, we were able to determine what users were looking for in such an application. We were able to reduce the number of folder option in our dashboard
          to create a higher balance of space and clarity. We focused on emphasizing certain elements based on our wireframe testing results. <br><br>The biggest lesson we learned was that aesthetics without a purpose is like an aerodynamic
          arrow without a target. This was an invaluable lesson that we will continue to use in the future.<br><br>Our target with this project was to promote a powerful cloud storage and project management application for entrepreneurs, without
          losing a sense of collaboration and security. From the feedback we received for our application, we certainly accomplished our objective. <br></p>
